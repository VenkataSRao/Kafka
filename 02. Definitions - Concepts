Below are concepts in kafka

Topic:
=======
A topic is a category or feed name to which messages are published. For each topic, kafka cluster maintains a 
partitioned log.

Producers:
============
They publish data to topics of their choice. The messages are assigned to partitions within the topic 
in a round-robin-fashion to balance load or could be done according to some function based on the key of the 
message.

Consumers: 
=============
There are 2 models: queuing and publish-subscribe. 
In a queue -> A pool of consumers read from a server and each message goes to one of them. 

In publish-subscribe -> message is broadcasted to all the consumers.
Consumers label themselves with a consumer group name and each message publichsed to a topic is delivered to one
consumer instance within each subscribing consumer group. consumer instances can be in separate processes or on 
separate machines.
